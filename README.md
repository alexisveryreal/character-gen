# Character Square Generator

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## WHY?

- at first I wanted to make a summon circle using emojis like "ðŸŽƒ"

- however i quickly realized that emojis have very different widths and to try to get the spacing right at least in code was nightmare ish.

- so now i just use simple characters like "*" to make a square and you can put whatever text you want inside of it.

- of course it won't always be the greatest but its SOMETHING at least.

- I will try to add to it later, and maybe find some other way to generate things.

## Future

- perhaps do some markdown gen?
